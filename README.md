# COVID19_VIRUS_ VISUALIZATION
## With the global pandemic being a hot topic of discussion, I read an article posted by Washington Post and view a video by 3DPT which inspired me to remake my own clone of the virus visualization. 
The model can be used with any other virus by uploading a dictionary of the disease parameters. 
---
Key Learning Outcomes:
* In depth understanding of both Matplotlib and Numpy library
* Created dictionaries to store virus parameters
* Created class virus 
* Defined functions that a replicable and generic to be reused
* In depth use conditional statement and loops
* Understanding the function of constructor '_init_:'
* Understanding how instance 'self:' operates
* Plotted final result using scatter plots

## Next Plan:
* To implement compare multiple diseases at the same time.
